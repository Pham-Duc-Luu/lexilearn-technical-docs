### Values

#### [<code style={{ fontWeight: 'normal' }}>ErrorType.<b>UNKNOWN</b></code>](#)  
Unknown error.

For example, this error may be returned when
an error code received from another address space belongs to
an error space that is not known in this address space.  Also
errors raised by APIs that do not return enough error information
may be converted to this error.

If a client sees an unknown errorType, it will be interpreted as UNKNOWN.
Unknown errors MUST NOT trigger any special behavior. These MAY be treated
by an implementation as being equivalent to INTERNAL.

When possible, a more specific error should be provided.

HTTP Mapping: 520 Unknown Error


#### [<code style={{ fontWeight: 'normal' }}>ErrorType.<b>INTERNAL</b></code>](#)  
Internal error.

An unexpected internal error was encountered. This means that some
invariants expected by the underlying system have been broken.
This error code is reserved for serious errors.

HTTP Mapping: 500 Internal Server Error


#### [<code style={{ fontWeight: 'normal' }}>ErrorType.<b>NOT_FOUND</b></code>](#)  
The requested entity was not found.

This could apply to a resource that has never existed (e.g. bad resource id),
or a resource that no longer exists (e.g. cache expired.)

Note to server developers: if a request is denied for an entire class
of users, such as gradual feature rollout or undocumented allowlist,
`NOT_FOUND` may be used. If a request is denied for some users within
a class of users, such as user-based access control, `PERMISSION_DENIED`
must be used.

HTTP Mapping: 404 Not Found


#### [<code style={{ fontWeight: 'normal' }}>ErrorType.<b>UNAUTHENTICATED</b></code>](#)  
The request does not have valid authentication credentials.

This is intended to be returned only for routes that require
authentication.

HTTP Mapping: 401 Unauthorized


#### [<code style={{ fontWeight: 'normal' }}>ErrorType.<b>PERMISSION_DENIED</b></code>](#)  
The caller does not have permission to execute the specified
operation.

`PERMISSION_DENIED` must not be used for rejections
caused by exhausting some resource or quota.
`PERMISSION_DENIED` must not be used if the caller
cannot be identified (use `UNAUTHENTICATED`
instead for those errors).

This error Type does not imply the
request is valid or the requested entity exists or satisfies
other pre-conditions.

HTTP Mapping: 403 Forbidden


#### [<code style={{ fontWeight: 'normal' }}>ErrorType.<b>BAD_REQUEST</b></code>](#)  
Bad Request.

There is a problem with the request.
Retrying the same request is not likely to succeed.
An example would be a query or argument that cannot be deserialized.

HTTP Mapping: 400 Bad Request


#### [<code style={{ fontWeight: 'normal' }}>ErrorType.<b>UNAVAILABLE</b></code>](#)  
Currently Unavailable.

The service is currently unavailable.  This is most likely a
transient condition, which can be corrected by retrying with
a backoff.

HTTP Mapping: 503 Unavailable


#### [<code style={{ fontWeight: 'normal' }}>ErrorType.<b>FAILED_PRECONDITION</b></code>](#)  
The operation was rejected because the system is not in a state
required for the operation's execution.  For example, the directory
to be deleted is non-empty, an rmdir operation is applied to
a non-directory, etc.

Service implementers can use the following guidelines to decide
between `FAILED_PRECONDITION` and `UNAVAILABLE`:

- Use `UNAVAILABLE` if the client can retry just the failing call.
- Use `FAILED_PRECONDITION` if the client should not retry until
the system state has been explicitly fixed.  E.g., if an "rmdir"
     fails because the directory is non-empty, `FAILED_PRECONDITION`
should be returned since the client should not retry unless
the files are deleted from the directory.

HTTP Mapping: 400 Bad Request or 500 Internal Server Error
